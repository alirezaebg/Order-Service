# Order Service
Treez Simple Order Service. On the hompage, enter your email address. After verifying your email address,
you can select to create a new order or view your existing orders. The first part is almost complete while 
the second part has not been done yet. Since I had the full stack design in mind, I used axios to connect 
the front-end to the back-end.

## Quick start
Follow these commands on terminal ro run the app locally. .env file is provided for accessing the database
```java
Server side: 
1. npm install
2. node server.js

Client side: 
1. npm install
2. npm start

```
Make sure Node.js is installed already. The program will be running on port 5000 for the server while
the front-end uses port 3000.


## Fraemworks/Tools/Libraries

1. Express
2. React
3. Axios
4. Bootstrap
5. Mongodb Atlas

## Database model
Please checkout the content of the model folder on the server side

## Testing (using Jest)
Not completed but Jest would have been used!
